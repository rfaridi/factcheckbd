Bangladesh government banned all types three wheelers in 22 national highways  effective from last August 1, 2015. It was surely a drastic measure to curb the fatalities in road accidents that has taken epidemic proportion recently in Bangladesh.

If you happen to live in Bangladesh for a considerable bit of time, you must have gotten quite accustomed to see the news of people dying in road accidents almost in the daily basis. It gets only headline news when a large number of death occurs or when high profile individuals are involved.

Otherwise, it has become just another ritual part of our daily life in Bangladesh. 

The death in road accidents vary wildly in Bangldesh. Official figures puts the number around 3,000 but other sources put the number from 12,000 to 20,000. 

A World Health Organisation (WHO) [publication](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/) reports that  21,316 deaths from road accidents occured in Bangladesh in one single year of 2012. Here is a newspaper [report](http://goo.gl/RlzFTp) on the issue. 

This twenty-one thousand odd figure puts daily road accident fatality  close to 60    which seems pretty high even in Bangladeshi standards. You can find some reports highly disputing this piece of information. 

The objective of this blog is not understanding the issue of huge discrepancy of reporting road accident death numbers but rather discussing the issue of banning three wheelers in Bangladesh highways.

In common perception, the idea is that most of the road accident related deaths happens on the national highways where heavy vehicles are involved in head-on collisions with other. Probably this is one of the major reasons which  prompted the ban. 

Sounds also reasonable. When a fast moving heavy vehicle finds a slow moving three wheeler in front of it, the first thing it tries is to over-take it. This often results in collission with vehicles coming from opposite direction. 

If this proposition is correct then we would assume that head on collision will act as the major source of casualty in road accidents. But let's see what we get from official statistics. 

Following analysis is done from the official statistics collected from [Accident Research Institute (ARI)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/ari) publication which is publicly available [here](http://www.buet.ac.bd/ari/downloads/Facts%202013.pdf). 

In the following we see a graph of the distribution of different types of Accidents in 2013:

![ari2013graph](../../road_accidents/ARIdatAnalysis/figure/gr13.png) 

Out of total 1,754 accidents in 2013, we find almost half of the total accidents involves hitting pedestrian. Head-on collision comes at a distant second causing 22.

In 2012, we see similiar pattern,

Same pattern can be also observed in 2011,

In fact, this very pattern can be observed for all the years dating back to 1998. This begs the very question whether the step will drammatically reduce the number of accidents. Hitting pedestrian may not happen due to slow moving three wheelers roaming around the highway. Its more likely because of different structures and institutions, such as markets are situated so close to highways and sometimes pretty much on the highway. As a result, it has become so common to see people taking the highway as their own yard and that is why probably we see such high rate of accidents involving pedestrians. 

The nature of this blog post is kind of exploratory in nataure. We need more research to find hard evidence in support of the statements we made so far.
