<p>Today (March 2, 2018) I have seen the following <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/country/bangladesh-ranks-among-the-lowest-rule-of-law-in-asia-1541899">the news on the Daily Star</a>, the leading news paper in Bangladesh on Bangladesh being close to bottom in South Asia. I went to <a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org">World Justice Project</a> and downloaded the data from their <a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/wjp-rule-law-index/wjp-rule-law-index-2017%E2%80%932018/current-historical-data">project page</a>. I think this is an absolutely great data to work on. Therefore, I am planning to do the following with the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>World choropleth according to rule of law</li>
<li>Finding relationship between GDP percapita and rule of law</li>
<li>A motion chart using historical data between GDP percapital and rule of law</li>
</ul>
