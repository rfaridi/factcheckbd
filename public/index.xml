      <description>I will be just practicing the exercises in the vignette of tidytext package.
let’s first import the required libraries:
library(janeaustenr) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(stringr) library(tidytext) As the very first step, we create line number variable and chapter variable.</description>

      <description>ggrepel has come to the picture to solve the problem of overlapping text. I thing it is pretty useful.
